# CHANGELOG

# [# 0.6.0 (2020-02-14) - Migration to Workspace Architecture + lexer/parser improvements](https://github.com/jasonwilliams/boa/compare/v0.5.1...HEAD)

The lexer has had several fixes in this release, including how it parses numbers, scientific notation should be improved.  
On top of that the lexer no longer panics on errors including Syntax Errors (thanks @adumbidiot), instead you get some output on where the error happened.

## Moving to a workspace architecture

Boa offers both a CLI and a library, initially these were all in the same binary. The downside is
those who want to embed boa as-is end up with all of the command-line dependencies.  
So the time has come to separate out the two, this is normal procedure, this should be analogous to ripgrep
and the regex crate.  
Cargo has great support for workspaces, so this shouldn't be an issue.
