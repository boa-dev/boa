# Boa Benchmarks.

We divide the benchmarks in 3 sections:
 - Execution benchmarks
 - Lexing benchmarks
 - Parsing benchmarks

The idea is to check the performance of Boa in different scenarios and dividing the Boa execution
process in its different parts.

Note that lexing benchmarks will soon disappear.
