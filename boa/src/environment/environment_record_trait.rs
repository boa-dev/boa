//! # Environment Records
//!
//! <https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-environment-records>
//! <https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-lexical-environments>
//!
//! Some environments are stored as `JSObjects`. This is for GC, i.e we want to keep an environment if a variable is closed-over (a closure is returned).
//! All of the logic to handle scope/environment records are stored in here.
//!
//! There are 5 Environment record kinds. They all have methods in common, these are implemented as a the `EnvironmentRecordTrait`
//!
