<!--
Thank you for adding a feature request to Boa! As this is an experimental JavaScript engine, there will probably be many ECMAScript features left to implement. In order to understand the feature request as best as possible, please fill the following template. Feel free to add or remove sections as needed.
-->

**ECMASCript feature**
Explain the ECMAScript feature that you'd like to see implemented.

<!-- E.g.:
I would like to see `switch` statement parsing and execution implemented. [ECMAScript specification][spec].

[spec]: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-switch-statement
-->

**Example code**
Give a code example that should work after the implementation of this feature.

<!-- E.g.:
This code should now work and give the expected result:
```javascript
let a = "hello";
let b;
switch (a) {
    case 'hello':
        b = 'world';
        break;
    case 'world':
        b = 'hello';
        break;
    default:
        b = 'hello world';
}
b;
```
The expected output is `world`.
