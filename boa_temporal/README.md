# Temporal in Rust

Provides a standard API for working with dates and time.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Temporal Proposal is still in Stage 3. As such, this crate should be viewed
as highly experimental until the proposal has been completely standardized and released.

## Goal

The intended goal of this crate is to provide an engine agnostic
implementation of `ECMAScript`'s Temporal algorithms.
