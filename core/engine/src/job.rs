//! Boa's API to create and customize `ECMAScript` jobs and job queues.
//!
//! [`Job`] is an ECMAScript [Job], or a closure that runs an `ECMAScript` computation when
//! there's no other computation running. The module defines several type of jobs:
//! - [`PromiseJob`] for Promise related jobs.
//! - [`TimeoutJob`] for jobs that run after a certain amount of time.
//! - [`NativeAsyncJob`] for jobs that support [`Future`].
//! - [`NativeJob`] for generic jobs that aren't related to Promises.
//!
//! [`JobCallback`] is an ECMAScript [`JobCallback`] record, containing an `ECMAScript` function
//! that is executed when a promise is either fulfilled or rejected.
//!
//! [`JobExecutor`] is a trait encompassing the required functionality for a job executor; this allows
//! implementing custom event loops, custom handling of Jobs or other fun things.
//! This trait is also accompanied by two implementors of the trait:
//! - [`IdleJobExecutor`], which is an executor that does nothing, and the default executor if no executor is
//!   provided. Useful for hosts that want to disable promises.
//! - [`SimpleJobExecutor`], which is a simple FIFO queue that runs all jobs to completion, bailing
//!   on the first error encountered. This simple executor will block on any async job queued.
//!
//! ## [`Trace`]?
//!
//! Most of the types defined in this module don't implement `Trace`. This is because most jobs can only
//! be run once, and putting a `JobExecutor` on a garbage collected object is not allowed.
//!
//! In addition to that, not implementing `Trace` makes it so that the garbage collector can consider
//! any captured variables inside jobs as roots, since you cannot store jobs within a [`Gc`].
//!
